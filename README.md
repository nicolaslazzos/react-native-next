# React Native Next

Project starter that includes a monorepo for a web and native application using react-native and react-native-web with react-navigation and native-base for the navigation and UI components respectively.

## Project Content

The project is a next and react-native project that uses react-native-web for working on web. Includes `react-navigation` and `native-base` with some basic configuration and sample components. Also includes `formik` for managing custom forms. All the shared code between the web and native application is inside the `/web/common/src` folder.

Review the installed packages because some of them may need some installation steps inside the `ios` folder that i did not do it because i dont have a mac.
